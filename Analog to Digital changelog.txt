= Removed the "Send key up when at 100% rate" option.
This is now calculated automatically. If the key is due to be held 100% of the time, a key up is not sent if only sending a single key.
If sending a sequence of keys, then it sends a keyup for one key and a keydown for the next at the same point in time.
