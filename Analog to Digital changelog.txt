2.1 17th Jul 2013
= Max and Min had got swapped, sorry...

2.0 16th Jul 2013
+ Completely new timing routine
+ Min and Max rate options
+ Deadzone setting
= UI cleanup, lots of tooltips added
= Readouts (Current Fire Rate etc) now make sense

1.3 15th Jul 2013
= Removed the "Send key up when at 100% rate" option.
This is now calculated automatically. If the key is due to be held 100% of the time, a key up is not sent if only sending a single key.
If sending a sequence of keys, then it sends a keyup for one key and a keydown for the next at the same point in time.
